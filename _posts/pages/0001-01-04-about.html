			<p>Welcome to Asia’s first on-line, interactive election monitoring initiative!</p>
  
			<p>Faced with the overwhelming election-cheating machinery of Sarawak’s BN party, Sarawak Report are fighting back with a people-based cheat beating monitoring service. We are inviting our army of readers to be our eyes and ears and expose all the bribing, bullying, ballot-box stuffing and downright lying they try to get up to over the coming weeks.</p>
  
			<p>Come on, it will also be fun. What these guys do, as we all know, is enough to make your eyes grow wide, jaw drop low and have you laughing out loud.</p>
  
			<p>So keep your camera or your mobile phone handy to snap a picture, record a video and grab the proof about what is going on. Last week Jabu went round his longhouses handing out 500 ringgit per door, while his son offered out crates of beer! So, let’s not just hear about it, next time make sure you help people get the pictures as well.</p>
			
			  <p>Record what people have been saying about the bribes they have been offered and by whom. Secretly film those guys who come to bribe and blackmail the poor voters as well. And then send it all in to our new web page called BEAT THE CHEATS!</p>

			 <p>The mailbox you need to send your material to is cheatbeat@sarawakreport.org We will upload your stories, photos and youtube links so that everyone can openly see how BN goes about trying to use the people’s own money to buy their votes!</p>
	  
			  <p>The material will be collated and pulled together into a report that will eventually be sent to the Election Commission, the MACC and most importantly to prosecutors, who we will instruct to take anyone caught cheating to court. So please give us full details about your complaints and provide us with contact details if you feel able to.</p>
	  
			  <p>This is a serious project, so let it be known now that civil servants or police, who indulge in supporting these BN practices will be in danger of finding themselves drawn into that prosecution, which will be doubly unpleasant for them if Taib does not win this time round. Far better to play the rules and give democracy a chance. That way they keep their dignity and their jobs if the government changes after April 16th.</p>
	  
			  <p>The information has already started rolling in so take a look at our site and start adding to it now!</p>
